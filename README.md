DARWIN PILOT: Adaptive Ship Route Optimization

Overview
DARWIN PILOT is an advanced ship route optimization system that leverages real-time forecasting data to dynamically adjust vessel routes. The system enhances maritime navigation by ensuring efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

Problem Statement
Traditional ship routing methods follow static paths, failing to account for real-time environmental changes. DARWIN PILOT introduces an adaptive approach to optimize ship routes dynamically based on maritime conditions.

Features
- Dynamic Ship Routing Algorithm that adjusts routes in real-time.
- Customized Maritime Travelling Salesman Problem (MTSP) model for optimized vessel movement.
- Real-time vessel tracking with route adjustments based on weather conditions.
- Post-voyage analysis for evaluating fuel consumption and optimizing future routes.
- Indian Ocean focus, aligning with Ocean Decade Vision 2030 and Maritime India Vision 2030.

Factors Considered
- Wind direction & speed
- Ocean currents
- Sea surface temperature
- Swell height, direction, and period
- Maximum & significant wave height
